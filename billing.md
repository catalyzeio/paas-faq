# PaaS Billing

### When do you start billing me for my PaaS environment?

We begin billing once your environment has been provisioned and deployed on Catalyze; essentially when your environment goes live. You will receive emails at time of billing. For trial accounts, billing begins the 30 days after your environment has been provisioned and deployed.

### What forms of payment do you accept?

We accept credit card payments processed through Stripe. We collect payment information immediate following contract signing. If credit card payments are not acceptable for you, please reach out to our [billing group](mailto:billing@catalyze.io) to explore other options.

### Do you offer non-production environments for things like development, staging, QA, demo, etc?

Yes, we do. The major differences between these non-production envrionments and our fully compliant production envrionments are that non-production envrionments do not include backup, disaster recovery, and an associated business assocaite agreement (BAA). Non-production environments mirror our production environments in all other ways, including having dedicated logging.

### How long does it take to deploy an environment on Catalyze?

We reserve 72 hours from acceptance of Service Order to provisioning your environment. Despite that, the vast majority are deployed the same day.

### When do you sign a business associate agreement (BAA)?

Once you accept the terms of the Service Order, we send you a BAA to sign. If you have questions about our BAAs, please reach out to our [compliance group](mailto:hipaa@catalyze.io)

### Do you have any additional requirements for signing a BAA?

No, we sign BAAs for all production environments. For non-production environments (development, staging, QA, etc) that don't need to be compliant, we do not sign BAAs.
