# Contact and Notifications

### How do I contact Catalyze support?

Contact Catalyze Support by using this [form](https://catalyzeio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  For requests regarding PaaS, please include your environment id. You can find the environment id in the url of the Dashboard for your environment.  You can also find the environment id when using the [paas-cli ](https://github.com/catalyzeio/catalyze-paas-cli) with the command `catalyze environments`

In addition, please review the Response-Times section of our [Service Agreement](https://legal.catalyze.io/#4-4-response-times)

`Catalyze shall provide Customer support, which shall be available Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. To 5:00 p.m. Central time, excluding holidays.`

### Can I get alerts about my environment?

Each PaaS environment comes with a Monitoring dashboard. Please see the [Accessing Monitoring](https://resources.catalyze.io/paas/getting-started/accessing-your-environment/accessing-monitoring/) section of our Resources page for more information regarding Monitoring.  We are working on a solution that will allow you to be notified when events occur.  Currently, you can subscribe an email address to be notified when an application build and redeployment has been completed.
